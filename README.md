# ðŸŽ¨ Blanchard - the art gallery <br>
Blanchard - web page of art studio. This is an example of my ability to create a one-page website using HTML, CSS, Javascript, BEM, pixel perfect etc. The project contains many custom, interactive elements. The landing page implements dropdown, custom scroll, dynamic sliders (swiper), custom select, accordion tabs, event cards (limited in number, the remaining ones are shown at the click of a button), custom checkbox, input, tooltip, Yandex map, a form with sending data to the mail, animation and transition.
